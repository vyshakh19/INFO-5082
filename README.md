Coronavirus Disease abbreviated as COVID–19 is an infectious disease which affected people in different ways and the infected people have a wide range of symptoms reported – from mild symptoms to severe illness or even death, few people recovered without any special treatment. 

This Project focuses on using Machine Learning Model for Predicting COVID-19 cases for the next 60 days and thus these types of predictive models help in providing an accurate prediction of epidemics, which is essential for obtaining information on the likely spread and consequences of infectious diseases. I have chosen the dataset which is necessary to analyse the past and the current data to predict which country will be affected or will have more COVID-19 cases and deaths further. 

In this project, I will perform cleaning and preparing of the dataset. And using the new dataset I will analyse the prediction for the next 60 days with good accuracy and then will develop a simple web application and deploy my model in it.
These predictions might help older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, and cancer.

In the past I have worked on covid-19 data by scrapping the twitter tweets. And thus, performed the Sentiment Analysis and topic modelling. I want to work further on this topic since COVID-19 is still getting worse in many countries.
